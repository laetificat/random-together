    <h2>Random Android Wear Invites project</h2>
    <p>
        This project is for people that has an Android Wear device with Together, since not everyone knows someone with
        a Wear device people are looking for a way to try out this feature. <br />That's where this project comes in handy,
        users can submit their Together invite and they will randomly be matched with another person.
    </p>

    <p>
        The project is still under heavy development and can be found on the Github repository, any help is appreciated.
        The idea is to use NodeJS together with Redis for a lightweight impact on the system and fast performance. The
        basic project (let's call it Alpha One) will not include any fancy stuff, just a form where you can enter your
        email, name, and Together invite.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: All your information will remain private and as soon there is a match, an email will be sent to both users
        containing the invite url and the information will be deleted forever. As stupid as it sounds, no backups will be
        created either to prevent any data being leaked.
    </p>

    <p>
        The more people use this project, the faster results will be. Just two people registering at the same time results
        in an instant match.
